# 新-Barliman (Shin-Barliman)

新-Barliman (or, "Shin-Barliman") is a prototype "smart" integrated development editor (IDE) that supports advanced program synthesis (templates, types, advanced search, etc.).

Kanae Tsushima (対馬かなえ) and Will Byrd


新-Barliman is a sequel to the Barliman Smart IDE (https://github.com/webyrd/Barliman), which was joint work by Will Byrd and Greg Rosenblatt.

新-Barliman will incorporate synthesis techniques from collaborators (in alphabetical order): Michael Ballantyne, Will Byrd, Greg Rosenblatt, Kanae Tsushima (対馬かなえ), Rob Zinkov.

Many thanks to Kenichi Asai and Youyou Cong for helpful discussions on generating program templates, and for general encouragement on this project.  In particular, Kenichi Asai's web tool for helping beginning OCaml programmers write their code through asking questions about types, program structure, and examples is a major influence on 新-Barliman.
