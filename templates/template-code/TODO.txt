Figure out what to do with this code:

(let ((results-fast (begin (set! allow-incomplete-search?#t) (results))))
  (if (null? results-fast)
      (begin (set! allow-incomplete-search? #f) (results))
      results-fast)))

that we had to change to:

(results)

in 'evalo-template-tests.scm', since 'allow-incomplete-search?' is exported as read-only.
