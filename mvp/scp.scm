;; Shin-Barliman Sub Controlling Process (SCP)

#|
Description of the Sub Controlling Process.
----------------------------------------

The MCP is responsible for coordinating communication between the
user interface (UI) and the sub-processes responsible for synthesis.

The MCP is also responsible for the policies and strategies used for
efficient synthesis.

; make subprocess
; (1) divide work to each subprocesses (create scm code? or MCP will send scm code?)
; (2) make subprocess & send information to subprocess
; (3) receive information from subprocess 
; Keeping simple: the number of subprocess will be two
