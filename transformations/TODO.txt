* Add arithmetic to relational interpreter

* Add ability to restrict grammar for holes (on a per-whole basis).  Would tree automata help?  How is this done in Sketch?

* Add constraints to ensure an accumulator argument/operator actually appear in a certain hole.  presento constraints?

* More examples of accumulator passing style

* Find examples for dynamic programming transformation

* Generate templates for APS and dynamic programming

* Set up infrastructure so it is faster, easier, more reliable to test synthesis problems and timings.
